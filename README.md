# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
    The purpose of this analysis was to find the amount of retiring employees. In addition, we found the number of employees eligible to parcipate in the companies' mentorship program. 
### Results
    -There are a total of 90,398 retiring current employees.
    -The majority of retiring employees are Senior Engineers & Senior Staff, with a count of 29,414 & 28,254.
    -There are a total of 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
    -Over 60% of employees eligible to retire hold a Senior role.
### Summary
    -Over 90,000 roles need to be filled to replace retiring employees
    -It does not seem like there will be enough mentors to prepare the next generation of PH Employees. One reccomendation would be to increase the number of mentors by widing the age range of these mentors. Instead of a one year window, i'd reccomend we increase it to a 5 year window.
